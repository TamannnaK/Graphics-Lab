# OpenGL Triangle Types â€” 
Student Name: Tamanna Khokon 
Student ID 0432310005101082

This project is a basic OpenGL rendering program that displays:
- A **Right-Angled Triangle** in the 1st quadrant (Red)
- An **Equilateral Triangle** in the 2nd quadrant (Green)
- An **Isosceles Triangle** in the 3rd quadrant (Blue)

Each triangle is drawn using:
- Separate **Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs)**
- Separate **Vertex Array Objects (VAOs)**
- A **single shader program** with dynamic color assignment

The background is white, and the rendering uses **OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile** with GLFW and GLAD.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- C++
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLAD

## ðŸ’¡ Build Instructions
Ensure you have GLFW and GLAD set up correctly in your build environment. Use CMake or a Makefile for easier compilation.
